## 🛠️ For Development Team

### Environment Setup
1. The demo uses mock data from `/api/mock-*` endpoints
2. No backend connection required
3. All data is static and for demonstration only

### Switching to Production Mode
To connect to the real backend (when fixed):
1. Update `.env` file with:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://shivshiyaresidency-production.up.railway.app/api
   ```
2. Remove the mock API files from `/api` folder

## 📝 Notes

- This is a demo version with limited functionality
- Data shown is mock data and not persistent
- Full functionality will be available once backend issues are resolved
